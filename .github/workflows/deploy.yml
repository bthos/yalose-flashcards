name: Deploy to QA and Production

# This workflow deploys the application through two environments:
# 1. QA - Deploys to /qa subdirectory on GitHub Pages for validation
# 2. Production - Deploys to root of GitHub Pages after QA validation
#
# Both QA and Production are deployed together to GitHub Pages, with QA accessible at /qa
# and Production at the root. The QA deployment persists even after production deployment.
#
# To configure manual approval between QA and Production:
# 1. Go to Settings > Environments in your GitHub repository
# 2. Create/edit the 'production' environment
# 3. Add required reviewers under "Deployment protection rules"
