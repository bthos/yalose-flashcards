name: Deploy to QA and Production

# This workflow deploys the application through two environments:
# 1. QA - Automatically deploys after successful build
# 2. Production - Deploys after QA (can be configured to require manual approval)
#
# To configure manual approval for Production:
# 1. Go to Settings > Environments in your GitHub repository
# 2. Create/edit the 'production' environment
# 3. Add required reviewers under "Deployment protection rules"
