name: Deploy to QA and Production

# This workflow deploys the application through two environments:
# 1. QA - Validates the build artifact and can include approval gates
# 2. Production - Deploys to GitHub Pages after QA validation
#
# To configure manual approval between QA and Production:
# 1. Go to Settings > Environments in your GitHub repository
# 2. Create/edit the 'production' environment
# 3. Add required reviewers under "Deployment protection rules"
#
# Note: GitHub Pages has a single deployment endpoint per repository.
# The QA environment serves as a validation gate before production deployment.
