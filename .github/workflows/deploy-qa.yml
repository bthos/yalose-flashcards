name: Deploy to QA

# This workflow deploys the QA build to GitHub Pages.
# Since GitHub Pages can only have one active deployment, this workflow deploys
# the QA build to the /qa subdirectory structure, making it accessible at /qa.
#
# Note: When the production workflow runs, it will include the QA build as well
# to ensure both QA and production coexist on GitHub Pages.
